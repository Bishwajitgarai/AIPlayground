I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my interest in the Software Developer position at your organization. With over 3 years of experience in backend development using Python, Django, Flask, and FastAPI, I have built scalable applications, optimized systems, and delivered AI-powered solutions that enhance efficiency and reliability.

Most recently, I led the development of MeetMemo, an AI-powered meeting assistant leveraging FastAPI, Redis, and MySQL for real-time processing, transcription, and analysis. I have also worked extensively with microservices, API integrations, automation, and cloud deployment, ensuring robust and maintainable systems.

I have attached my CV for your review. I would be delighted to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your team‚Äôs success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
